        <h3>Membership</h3>
        
        <p>Beekeepers across the country are joining the American Beekeeping Federation (ABF), the national association that makes a difference in the beekeeping industry. The ABF has been serving the needs of the U.S. beekeeper for over 60 years.  Today, there are many challenges facing our industry that are endangering the very existence of the honeybee, nature's most valuable insect.</p>
        
        <p>Whether from disease or shrinking habitat, detrimental legislation or new science that is modifying nectar sources in ways we have yet to fully understand, you need to be informed.  Information is the key to surviving as a beekeeper today.  Networking with those in the industry who are leading the way to the future is a value that can be priceless if you wish to succeed in the business of keeping bees.</p>
        
        <p><q>Joining the ABF was the best thing I have done to improve my ability to care for our bees. We are fruit farmers who became beekeepers of necessity for pollination. We have since discovered that beekeepers are a lot like fishermen in that everyone insists their way is the only way but no one actually has factual research to support their position. The ABF is a breath of fresh air in the strongly academic approach and open exploration of new ideas and methods.</q> - Gary Winkel</p>
