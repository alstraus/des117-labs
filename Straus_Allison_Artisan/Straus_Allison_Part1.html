        Although he is best known for his paintings, Edward Hopper was a trained illustrator with a career background in advertising and etching. He didn’t like this line of work, but it was a means of supporting himself while making art. As time went on, he began to showcase his artwork. In 1913, he sold his first painting, Sailing (1911), in the International Armory Show. His artwork was displayed alongside the work of artists such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Cézanne, and Edgar Degas.

            He married his former classmate and fellow painter, Josephine Nivison, in 1924. She became the subject for most of his paintings, and influenced Hopper’s transition from oil painting to watercolors. With art connections from his wife, he became very successful and was able to quit his job as an illustrator. During this time, he created his most famous painting, <cite> Nighthawks (1942) </cite>. In the mid 20th century, Hopper’s popularity took a hit as abstract expressionism gained popularity. Despite this, he continued to create work and receive critical acclaim. His work was placed on 1961 Time Magazine cover and Jacqueline Kennedy chose his painting, House of Squam Light, Cape Ann, to be placed in the White House. As he got older, he suffered from various health issues, which hindered his painting ability. He passed away in his New York home at the age of 84 on May 15, 1967.
